This is a project to that I am doing to demonstrate several of the skills that I've learned during my Fullstack Academy bootcamps. I intend this to do the following:

- Create PSQL tables that only contain information related to the many, many Westerns about Jesse James.
- Paginate lists that displays the movies based on various criterias.
  -- A page that sorts on release dates.
  -- A page that sorts based on box office returns.
  -- A page that sorts based on critic reception.
- To gather the basic movie information I will use the IMDB.com API, TMDB.
- I will research other APIs to gather the other data.
- Later I will add streaming and purchasing opptions to each title.

To begin this project I will crate the backend with testing tables so that I can be sure the routes are working correctly before I start pulling information from the APIs.
